title: After Washing my Socks
---
I put my socks in the wash. After they dried, I noticed that they were loose and droopy, not tight and well shapen like they had been when I bought them years ago, a sign to throw them away. I thought about my own body. I do want to have children one day. Will I expend, loose my shape? And at that point in time, what will I have to give? Youth slips out of me everyday. Tomorrow I will turn 25 (then 26, and I'm too old for Leonardo DiCaprio). My body will loosen, loosen, I'll mary a man, he will see this, witness this loosening, and then he will look away, look for another bright eyed girl, younger, fitter. 

No, Erika, you are not a sock. Release yourself from the metaphorical prison of the sock!!

I picked up a vitamin C serum yesterday. Vitamin C includes antioxidents, which help prevent signs of aging. Next, I will try retinol, another cure for aging. Reverse the hourglass, stop the flow of time, one potion at a time. I sleep glossed in moisturizers and toners, like Snow White in the glass coffin, manifesting glass skin and endless youth.
