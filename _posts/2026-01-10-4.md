title: thinking of getting a beanbag chair
---

I was talking to my sister today. We're working on sprucing up my brother's room in the basement. She wants to get a chair for his room - not an office chair, but something for relaxing, like a recliner. It got me thinking that maybe my room needs a bean bag chair. I have 2 office chairs and a bed and those are the only places I sit. It might be nice to have a bean bag chair because I could lounge around and relax in a way that you can't do in an office chair. You can relax in a bed but it's for sleeping, and its not healthy to lay down all day. If I got a bean bag chair I think I would read a lot of books on it. 

I read a book called Pond recently - that also inspired this post. It was made up entirely of the mundane musings of a young woman. I found it incredibly interesting. I think I just like high brow meandering novems centered on women. Maybe one day i'll write one myself.
