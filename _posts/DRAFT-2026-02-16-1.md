title: dinner in the desolate light

"It's dark outside but the lighting," Johhny said, "makes this place look desolate." The place was Kabizza, a little mediterranean restaurant in Tempe. I wouldn't say it looked "desolate," but the tile floors, stained fabric booths, and dim lighting certainly provided a humble atmosphere. It was a few days before my scheduled wisdom teeth removal. A last supper, per say. "Yeah, I'm getting 8 teeth out," I explained. "8?" Johnny looked incredulous. Every time I told someone the story of my wizzies I got a reaction like this. It was always a face of shock, then a slight look of pity. It amused me, it comforted me. If only I could take everyone's faces to the operating room, to have everyone's pity as a cushion while the dentist yanked my teeth out.

For my meal I had loaded chicken fries. I told the cashier no white ranch. She said they didn't use white ranch. When I got the fries they were smeared with what appeared to be white ranch. But maybe it was that garlic sauce she was talking about. Whatever.

The fries were mid. I mean, the actual fries themselves were good, crispy. But the chicken was plain and there was too much sauce. I felt very heavy after eating. I gathered all the ranch in a goopy pile and accidently flicked it onto my jeans. Damnit! My favorite Old Navy jeans too.
