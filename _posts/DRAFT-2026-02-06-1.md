the frantic motions of phuongs hands
the clacking of the pool balls

phuong focused on the ball, the goal, actually she's always focused
cousin dynamics, being loud, family vibes
coming up the mountain the exhilaration the anxiety the feeling of triumphs of holding onto nothing the woman who was rescued has a seizure did she see the mountains the view and then? nothing?
the lady at the door marked my hand with a black x
i sat on the bench while they played pool and hoped they didn't knock me out with the stick i was behind them
