title: I'm just so profoundly disappointed in the state of this country, but how can I be surprised in a nation that was founded on the tenets of colonial violence and brutality?

something something it's complicated being a daughter of immigrants that choose to come here, and i'm grateful to be here, i'm mostly safe in my everyday life, but these safeties come from the sufferings of others, and that doesn't feel great, and i can see this safety is slipping away, and what can i do, i have work tomorrow right? and by the way black people have been murdered by the state and nobody seemed to care, and nothing changed and why are people outraged now but not then? the justic department shut down all the police brutality investigations by the way, the ones here in the desert too, and if you read the files its very bad, [just a year ago the cops here killed an innocent man](https://www.azfamily.com/2026/01/07/lawsuit-filed-against-glendale-after-unarmed-man-mistakenly-shot-killed-by-officer/), nobody is in jail, nothing changed, nothing changed
