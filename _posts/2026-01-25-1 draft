One of my New Year's Resolutions has been to "Consume More" and "Create More." It's a cyclical concept - I believe that if I consume more of the creative outputs of others, whether it's fiction, poetry, music, or other forms of visual art, then this provides a well of inspiration which I can draw from the create more of my own artistic works. Julia Cameron discusses this in her book "The Artist's Way." She advises artists to go on "Artist's Dates" once a week, as a way of "nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist, [...] your creative child." The artist date also fits into my other resolution to go outside more. In the past few week, I've gone to a few concerts for some hyper indie local bands, and I've really been filling my creative cup.

One place I've gone to this month is the Linger Longer Lounge.
