title: My 2025 Poetry Publications

I wanted to collate all of my publications from 2025. Mostly because I lost track, and when I mention my publications to others I don't have the links handy so they can read them. I figure if I collect it here, I can have an easy link to share with others that are interested in my work.

I also wanted to include a poem that was published in the Spring of 2022. It's called [Dilemma and it was published in Spires Magazine (Page 12).](https://issuu.com/spiresmagazinewustl/docs/spires_spring_2022_final) Sometimes people ask about this poem, so I wanted to include a link that is easily accessible for sharing.

Overall, I'm very happy that all these poems found a home. I'm hoping to continue the streak by simply writing and submitting to more places this year!
